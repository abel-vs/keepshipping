# ðŸš¢ keepshipping

a social media for builders.

## manifesto

social media can be too distracting.
this is a social media for builders.

the goals of keepshipping are:

1. to motivate you to ship daily
2. to keep you accountable
3. to take away as little time as possible

we believe the best way to improve is to build things and ship them. and that doing this daily compounds into great things.

so join along, and keep shipping!
